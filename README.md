# CalculiX to Salome converter (inp to unv)

Converts [CalculiX](http://dhondt.de/) .inp file to [Salome](https://www.salome-platform.org/) .unv format.

<br/><br/>



# How to use

Python3 is needed.

Result UNV-file name is the same as INP-file name. So only one argument should be passed to the converter:

    python unv2ccx.py file.inp

<br/><br/>
